RDF data harvesting and preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A command-line user can run a script to harvest RDFa from a specified URL and save it as RDF XML, in order to keep a current copy of the data for aggregation and use in other context.
* When a command-line user runs the RDFa harvesting script, they can optionally harvest content from related URLs, so that they can gather data for multiple related pages at once.
* A command-line user can run a script to generate RDF for the Belfast Group sheets held by Queens University Belfast so that MARBL and Queens Group sheet information can be aggregated together.
* A command-line user can run a script to "smush" harvested RDf for Belfast Group sheets, so that different copies of the same sheet can be linked together and referenced without duplication.
* A command-line user can run a script to harvest RDF data from DBpedia, VIAF, and GeoNames for persons, places, and organizations referenced in the harvested RDF, so that additional data can be queried or referenced in the new Belfast Group website.
* A user will be able to harvest and prep RDF dataset with a single script so the process is reliable and repeatable.
* When a user runs the script to harvest and prep the Belfast Group RDF dataset,  manuscripts will be recognized and labeled as Belfast Group sheets so that all Belfast Group sheets can easily be identified for display and visualization on the site.
* Custom RDF ontology which includes a Belfast Group Sheet type

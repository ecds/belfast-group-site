<h3>Original Site (circa 2000)</h3>
<p>Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> builds on Emory&rsquo;s <a href="../../../../overview/#original-site">original &ldquo;Belfast Group&rdquo; website</a> that launched circa 2000. A copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702162454/http://beck.library.emory.edu/BelfastGroup/">that site is still accessible via the Internet Archive</a>. That site was also a collaborative effort, and we list here the different team members responsible for that original project. We have included their current positions&mdash;as of December 2014&mdash;in parentheses.</p>

<h2>Poetry</h2>
<p>When the Belfast Group met, the authors read their in-progress work from &ldquo;Group sheets.&rdquo; These Group sheets are held by Emory&rsquo;s <a href="http://marbl.library.emory.edu/">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a> (MARBL) and the <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/lib/">Library at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast</a>. 
<p>For the original &ldquo;Belfast Group&rdquo; site, select poets gave permissions for Group sheets with drafts of their poems to be digitized and published. Since these are drafts, some of the poems differ from their published versions.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the following poets for their willingness to allow their drafts to be digitized and published:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ciaran Carson</li>
<li>Seamus Heaney</li>
<li>Philip Hobsbaum</li>
<li>Brendan Kennelly</li>
<li>Michael Longley</li>
<li>Paul Muldoon</li>
<li>James Simmons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software Developed</h2>
<p>To better represent the relationships of the authors working in the Belfast Group and to connect the information in the archival finding aids with the digitized texts, the &ldquo;Networking Belfast&rdquo; project developed software to enhance the TEI and EAD. We also updated the <a href="http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/">EmoryFindingAids</a> site to expose the names and URIs now embedded in the EAD via RDFa. Finally, the Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> site depends on content pulled from both TEI and EAD, combined with the use of RDF.</p>

<h2>Partner Organizations</h2>
<p>Both the original &ldquo;Belfast Group&rdquo; website and Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> benefitted from partnership with other organizations. Emory University&rsquo;s MARBL and Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast provided the Group sheets. The Lewis H. Beck Center for Electronic Collections created the original &ldquo;Belfast Group&rdquo; site and acted as consultants throughout the creation of Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em>. Finally, the &ldquo;Networking Belfast&rdquo; project was carried out under the auspices of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) in connection with its grant from the Mellon Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Original Site (circa 2000)</h3>
<p>Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> builds on Emory’s <a href="/overview/#original-site">original “Belfast Group” website</a> that launched circa 2000. A copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702162454/http://beck.library.emory.edu/BelfastGroup/">that site is still accessible via the Internet Archive</a>. That site was also a collaborative effort, and we list here the different team members responsible for that original project. We have included their current positions&mdash;as of December 2014&mdash;in parentheses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chuck Spornick, Beck Center Director (Director of Services for the Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory University)</li>
<li>Stephen Enniss, Modern Literature Curator, Special Collections (Director of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in Austin)</li>
<li>Alice Hickcox, technical staff (Digital Text Specialist in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship)</li>

<li>Rebecca Sutton Koeser, student assistant, programmer (Senior Software Engineer in Library and Information Technology Services at Emory University)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poetry</h2>
<p>When the Belfast Group met, the authors read their in-progress work from “Group sheets.” These Group sheets are held by Emory’s <a href="http://marbl.library.emory.edu/">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library</a> (MARBL) and the <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/lib/">Library at Queen’s University Belfast</a>. 
<p>For the original “Belfast Group” site, select poets gave permissions for Group sheets with drafts of their poems to be digitized and published. Since these are drafts, some of the poems differ from their published versions.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the following poets for their willingness to allow their drafts to be digitized and published:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ciaran Carson</li>
<li>Seamus Heaney</li>
<li>Philip Hobsbaum</li>
<li>Brendan Kennelly</li>
<li>Michael Longley</li>
<li>Paul Muldoon</li>
<li>James Simmons</li>
</ul>
<h2>Photographs</h2>

<h2>Software Developed</h2>
<p>To better represent the relationships of the authors working in the Belfast Group and to connect the information in the archival finding aids with the digitized texts, the “Networking Belfast” project developed software to enhance the TEI and EAD. We also updated the <a href="http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/">EmoryFindingAids</a> site to expose the names and URIs now embedded in the EAD via RDFa. Finally, the Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> site depends on content pulled from both TEI and EAD, combined with the use of RDF.</p>

<h2>Partner Organizations</h2>
<p>Both the original “Belfast Group” website and Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em> benefitted from partnership with other organizations. Emory University’s MARBL and Queen’s University Belfast provided the Group sheets. The Lewis H. Beck Center for Electronic Collections created the original “Belfast Group” site and acted as consultants throughout the creation of Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em>. Finally, the “Networking Belfast” project was carried out under the auspices of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) in connection with its grant from the Mellon Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Belfast Group Authors by Period</h2>
<p>This network graph treats the two periods of the Group&#8212when Hobsbaum chaired (1963-1966) and when the Heaneys, Arthur Terry, and Michael Allen organized it (196-1972)&#8212as two separate entities. Most of the Group sheets are undated, but some include handwritten dates, times, and places. Absent that information, we have assumed that undated sheets in Hobsbaumâ€™s papers are from the Group's first time period and that undated sheets from other collections are from the second period.</p> 

<p>In most cases, the nodes represent the authors of Group sheets and show a connection to one or both periods of the Group, depending on when he or she contributed Group sheets. The graph also shows those whose papers include Group sheets but did not author them. Edges are drawn between authors and owners of Group sheets since they presumably attended that particular Group meeting together. In the case of multiple authors of a single Group sheet or of more than one individual having a copy of a Group sheet in his collection, an edge is also drawn between those individuals. The weight of the connection is based on the number of Group sheets authored or owned.</p>

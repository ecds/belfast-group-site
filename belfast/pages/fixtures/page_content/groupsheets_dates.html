The following provides additional information about likely dates for individual Group sheets, arranged by author.

<h3>Lynette M. Croskery</h3>
<ul>
<li>The original Group sheet in the Hobsbaum Collection at Queen’s dates Lynette M. Croskery’s &ldquo;The Dress&rdquo; as April 12, 1966 (likely the date the poem was completed). If Philip Hobsbaum left Belfast for Glasgow in March 1966, as he recalls in his essay &ldquo;The Belfast Group: A Recollection,&rdquo; then it is unclear how this Group sheet made its way into the Hobsbaum Collection (173).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Norman Dugdale</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Seated King and Queen&rdquo; was read at the workshop on December 13, 1971, according to a letter from Michael Allen to Stephen Enniss.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seamus Heaney</h3>
<ul>
<li>The copy of Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Boy Driving His Father to Confession&rdquo; that is in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8zkmf">Michael Longley papers</a> in MARBL includes the handwritten note &ldquo;April 27, 1965.&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Digging&rdquo; can be dated to Spring 1964, according to Hobsbaum (175).</li>
<li>The copies of the Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Servant Boy&rdquo; in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8zw5k">James Simmons papers</a> and the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8z3n4">Ciaran Carson papers</a> in MARBL both include a handwritten note &ldquo;Monday, November 8th&rdquo;. Given the date and the day of the week, we believe these poems were presented in 1971.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Philip Hobsbaum</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a single Hobsbaum Group sheet that we have assigned to the second period: the one that starts with &ldquo;Dead End.&rdquo; This might seem unusual since it would have been presented after he had left for Glasgow. Yet in a letter to Stephen Enniss, Hobsbaum write the following, &ldquo;&lsquo;Dead End&rsquo; was the latest and was one that was read out and discussed when I was a resident in Glasgow after Belfast, on one of the occasions that I went back as a visitor.&rdquo; (Philip Hobsbaum, letter to the author, 14 Dec. 1998).

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Michael Longley</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;No Continuing City&rdquo; is dated 22 Nov. 1964. However, this is likely the date the final poem, &ldquo;The Hebrides,&rdquo; was completed rather than the date the sheet was prepared or presented. The copy of this worksheet in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8zkmf">Michael Longley papers</a> in MARBL includes substantial deletions to the text.</li>
<li>The Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;To the Poets&rdquo; is undated. However the final poem on the sheet, &ldquo;Caravan&rdquo; is dated 29 December 1970.</li>
<li>The Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Altera Cithera&rdquo; is dated 31 January in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8zqq8">Frank Ormsby papers</a> in MARBL. We suspect that the year was 1972, given the day of the week in which the workshop was normally held.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bernard McLaverty</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Group sheet with Bernard McLaverty&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;Jim Scroggy&rdquo; does not appear in the Hobsbaum Collection at Queen&rsquo;s. However, since Hobsbaum recalls that this &ldquo;early story&rdquo; was presented during his chairing of the Group, we have assigned it to the first period of the Group.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trevor McMahon</h3>
<ul>
<li>According to a note in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8z3n4">Ciaran Carson papers</a> in MARBL, the single Group sheet from McMahon was read on 22 November. Given the days of the week that the workshop met, we suspect that it was presented in 1971.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paul Muldoon</h3>
<ul>
<li>While the Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Stillborn&rdquo; is undated, the final poem on the sheet, &ldquo;Leaving the Island&rdquo; is dated 1969.</li>
<li>According to a note in the <a href="http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/8z3n4">Ciaran Carson papers</a> in MARBL, the Muldoon Group sheet that begins with &ldquo;Blowing Eggs&rdquo; was read on 25 October. We believe that it was workshopped in 1971.</li>

    <h2>What Do We Mean When We Say "Belfast Group"?</h2>

<p>If you are going to create a project investigating the relationships among members of the Belfast Group, it’s important to know exactly what that Group is. Being specific about this when creating our data was critical so we could accurately measure who was connected to this <em>thing</em> we call "the Belfast Group." But, as is often happens with humanities data, it turns out that things are a little messy. In this case, while the term originally refers to the writing workshop began by Philip Hobsbaum, many critics and commentators have also used it to refer to the idea of a Belfast "school" of poets (see Clark 1, 6). Many members of this supposed school&mdash;Seamus Heaney and Michael Longley, among others&mdash;were, of course, participants in the writing workshop, which adds to the slippage between the two uses. But while it’s demonstrably true that a writing workshop existed, it’s far less clear whether there was any unified purpose that might constitute a school.<sup id="ref-wn1" class="note"><a href="#wn1">[1]</a></sup> For the purposes of this site, then, when we speak of the "Belfast Group," we mean the weekly writing workshop founded by Hobsbaum and continued by Seamus and Marie Heaney, along with Michael Allen and Arthur Terry.</p>

<p>Even having made it clear what we mean when we say "the Belfast Group", it’s also true that the writing workshop was not a single, consistent entity. Split into two phases and involving a rotating cast of authors&mdash;some of whom deny their involvement or its significance&mdash;the Group was anything but the fixed entity that would be desirable for conventional data analysis. And the multiplicitous nature of the workshop was more than just membership. Individual accounts of how the Group worked or who was involved regularly contradict each other. Trying to account for all of these varying perspectives 50 years later, it is even more difficult to know what the Group was and how it functioned. Indeed, given these conflicting memories one of the goals of this project is to create an alternate way of considering what the Belfast Group was. The data-centric representation of the Group is, of course, not "Truth," with a capital T, but simply one more perspective, as we write in our essay about <a href="#archival-bias">archival bias</a>.</p>

<p>What follows here is a brief accounting of the Group members’ singular perceptions of the writing workshop and some of our thoughts about doing data work on an entity which is anything but singular.</p>

<h3>Group Think? Conflicted Reminiscences of the Workshop</h3>

<p>When trying to understand the Belfast Group, it seems logical to go to the source: the people who participated in it. Yet, in a collection of memories about the group&mdash;termed a "Symposium"&mdash;published in the <em>Honest Ulsterman</em> in 1976, we find a number of conflicting descriptions of the workshop. Longley described being "rather surprised by the ferocity of Hobsbaum’s attack" on his work, but that he eventually "look[ed] forward masochistically to the seasonal maulings" (Dugdale et al. 57). Jack Pakenham recounts enjoying the "verbal battles which were part and parcel of the meetings" (Dugdale et al. 58), and Derek Mahon claimed that the Group met to "read and savage one another’s work" ("Poetry in Northern Ireland" 90). Simmons, on the other hand, recalled that "all there was kindness and encouragement," a fact which "irritated" him as it diluted any potential feedback (Dugdale et al. 59). Bernard MacLaverty, in a 2000 interview, suggested that Hobsbaum would always "find something to say to validate what was written on the page" (qtd. in Clark 44). And Joan Watton Newmann described “the ethos [Philip Hobsbaum] created and sustained was one of pleasure and discovery. There was no space for destruction” (“Coming of Age” 118). Arthur Terry split the difference between the camps, calling the workshop’s tone "an agreeable mixture of friendliness and astringency," as did Seamus Heaney, who wrote that if Hobsbaum "drove some people mad with his absolutes and hurt others with his overbearing, he confirmed as many with his enthusiasms" (Dugdale et al. 61, 62).</p>

<p>In addition to disagreeing about the general tenor of meetings, the Group participants also express differing opinions about the types of poetry that were favored at the meetings. Both Pakenham and Longley comment on a particular aesthetic bias that ruled the group. As Longley put it, "Hobsbaum’s aesthetic demanded gritty particularity, an unrhetorical utterance" (Dugdale et al. 56). This mode conflicted, he notes, with both Pakenham’s "free-wheeling surrealist verse" and his own disposition "as a lapsed Classicist" (Dugdale et al. 56). Terry, on the other hand, writes that "nothing approaching a ‘group-mentality’ ever emerged" given "the sheer range of opinions and the presence of so much individual talent" (Dugdale et al. 61). Perhaps, then, Pakenham and Longley noticed the dominant aesthetic because they found themselves so far outside the prevailing style.</p>

<p>The members also had differing perspectives on the mix of people involved in the workshop. Pakenham thought the group was too academic and "University orientated [sic]," because "the majority of the Group [...] were either University Lecturers or their students" (Dugdale et al. 57). But Arthur Terry felt that one of the Group’s strengths was its "being a meeting-place for people of very different backgrounds and interests, many of whom were refreshingly unconnected with the University" (Dugdale et al. 61). Since Terry taught at the university, the inclusion of <em>anyone</em> from outside that world could have felt like a breath of fresh air; for Pakenham, who was from outside the academy, although he was at the time "an English teacher involved in the teaching of Literature," the number of university-affiliated members must have felt conspicuous (Dugdale et al. 58).<sup id="ref-wn2" class="note"><a href="#wn2">[2]</a></sup> Yet this difference in opinion might not come down to different perspectives: Terry and Pakenham might also be remembering the Group at different points over the course of its nine years. The Group really <em>might</em> have been different given its separate phases and conveners and what Hobsbaum called the "turnover of talent" (Dugdale et al. 55). For example, Michael Longley writes that he "never saw Simmons at a Group meeting" (Dugdale et al. 56). Thus, while Heaney commented in 1976 that the Group allowed the public to think of the writers as a "single, even singular phenomenon," this seems to be a kind of useful fiction (for both public and writers), and was clearly an oversimplification even at that point in time (Dugdale et al. 62).</p>

<p>Whether or not the writing workshop was dominated by people affiliated with Queen’s University, most individuals haven’t questioned their participation in the Group. But that is precisely the case with Derek Mahon. In 1970, Mahon wrote an article in <em>Twentieth Century Studies</em> about the development of "Poetry in Northern Ireland." He mentions the "group seminar which met weekly in [Hobsbaum’s] flat" and suggests that "The Hobsbaum seminar (known as ‘the Group’...) was probably the first to crystalise the sense of a new Northern poetry" ("Poetry in Northern Ireland" 90, 91). In continuing, Mahon clarifies the importance that the Group had for the authors in Northern Ireland: "Here was this man from London, people thought, whose name and whose friends’ names appeared in leading journals, and he’s actually taking us <em>seriously</em>" (91, original emphasis). Perhaps it is the "us" in "he’s actually taking us seriously" or the fact that Mahon writes so knowingly&mdash;if briefly&mdash;about the Group here, but many people associated him with the workshop. This could have also come through his close friendship with Longley.<sup id="ref-wn3" class="note"><a href="#wn3">[3]</a></sup> Longley was clearly a member of the writing workshop&mdash;although not a founding one, despite Hobsbaum’s occasionally listing him as such<sup id="ref-wn4" class="note"><a href="#wn4">[4]</a></sup>&mdash;and it therefore stood to reason that his compatriot Derek must be as well. Yet Mahon claims to have only gone to a single meeting of the Group and has since vehemently denied playing any real part in it, as he did in a 1991 interview: "I was not a member of Philip Hobsbaum’s fucking Belfast Group. I was in a different city. I was a member of my own group in Dublin. I went <em>once</em> to Philip’s group, and never again" ("Q. and A." 28, original emphasis).<sup id="ref-wn5" class="note"><a href="#wn5">[5]</a></sup> While he might have attended only a single time, we do have one Group sheet of Mahon’s poems in the collections at MARBL, which suggests that his poems were discussed on one evening. At first glance this seems to suggest that Mahon did more than <em>just</em> drop by the meeting, as he likely would have had to schedule his attendance and make the poems available to the Heaneys, Terry, or Allen ahead of time for distribution. But as Stephen Enniss discusses in his recent biography of Mahon, "a number of the poems present on the sheet were not written until after Mahon had left Belfast for Canada" (269 n. 62). Enniss suggests that Longley probably "took it upon himself to prepare a Group sheet of Mahon’s poems that he presented in his place" (270 n. 62).</p>

<p>Yet earlier on, at the time of his article in <em>Twentieth Century Studies</em> Mahon might have been less disinclined to be considered part of a group that was making some literary noise. Mahon himself describes Northern Ireland as a "cultural desert" in the 1950s and, in the opinion of many, "traditionally philistine" ("Poetry in Northern Ireland" 90, 89). Heaney suggests that Hobsbaum’s ability to energize the Belfast literary scene was in part because he had "trust in the parochial, the inept, the unprinted" (Dugdale et al. 62). If these two descriptions are accurate, one could imagine that inclusion in a group that had some literary recognition would have been valuable to young poets. But once the individual authors’ reputations were on the ascent, it would perhaps be less desirable to be seen as members of a "school." Indeed, while Mahon is the only person who challenges his association of the Group, many others have downplayed its importance for and, by extension, Hobsbaum influence on their writing. Longley, for example, writes that "I can honestly say that I didn’t alter one semi-colon as the result of Group discussion" (Dugdale et al. 57).<sup id="ref-wn6" class="note"><a href="#wn6">[6]</a></sup> Pakenham believed that the excellent poems and stories he heard at the group were written "in spite of the criticism expressed there not because of it" (Dugdale et al. 58). Others declined to comment in <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>’s "Symposium" "on the grounds that they regarded the meetings as little more than pleasant social occasions"&mdash;at least as they looked back from the more established literary moment of 1976 (Dugdale et al. 53).<sup id="ref-wn7" class="note"><a href="#wn7">[7]</a></sup> Yet Mahon, of all people, wrote that Hobsbaum’s "enthusiasm generated activity in people who might otherwise have fallen silent" ("Poetry in Northern Ireland" 91).</p>

<p>Regardless of what the Belfast Group was, how it worked, or who felt that it was important, there was one thing that everyone appears to agree on: the reason for being there. As Stewart Parker writes, "What did we find to talk about so interminably [...] why, the world was young, poetry was under every stone, just waiting to crawl out and be mimeographed. Poetry! God how we craved it, molested it, exalted it, lived it&mdash;but above all explicated it!" (Dugdale et al. 59).</p>

<h3>Memories vs. Data</h3>
<p>It’s important to remind ourselves of the difficulty of knowing what the Belfast Group was when analyzing it from a data-centric point of view. After all, visualizing the relationships among the Group and its members requires us to treat it as a single entity with a stable identity. We seem to confirm this thinking, whether it is meaningful or accurate, when we create an entry for the Group itself in a dataset or use a <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/138541895/">linked-data URI</a> for reference. The neatness of a single-line entry for the writing workshop seems to contradict the contradictory recollections of its many different participants.</p>

<p>A desire to overcome this all-too-singular thinking is part of the motivation for creating the visualizations on Belfast Group Poetry|<em>Networks</em>. The graphs and maps do not seek to resolve the incompatible reminiscences of the Group so much as present one more lens through which to view its activities and thereby disrupt the notion of a static thing that was the "Belfast Group." For example, our <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second network graph</a>, attempts to fracture the concept of a stable Group by highlighting the Group during its two separate time periods. This visualization makes it easy to see that there really were two different groups of people participating in the workshop. Individuals like Stewart Parker, Joan Watton Newmann, Brian Scott, and J. K. Johnston only participated in the first instantiation, and Ciaran Carson, Paul Muldoon, and Trevor McMahon, among others, attended only when the Heaneys were leading the Group. This graph also helps us identify those individuals who span both phases, among them Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, and James Simmons, but also Iris Bull, Maurice Gallagher, Norman Dugdale, and more. A version of this second network graph is presented below in a static form so as to make it easier to read. We have also colored the different nodes on the graph according to algorithmic community detection, where the computer identifies subsets of nodes that are tightly connected to each other.</p>

<p>TODO Include GEXF image</p>

<p>Of course, it should be said again that this visualization is incomplete. Since it only represents those who authored or owned Group sheets from this particular period, many individuals do not appear. Marie Heaney, for example, was clearly a participant in both phases of the workshop, but she does not appear in this visualization due to how the Group worked and due to cataloging practices (which we <a href="#women">address below</a>). Similarly, Brian Scott might have attended during the second phase but simply not authored or owned any Group sheets that have made their way into the collections at Emory or Queen’s.</p>

<p>By transforming our data in other ways, we’re able to gain insights into the Group members’ relationships with one another. As mentioned above, the influence of the workshop on the participants’ writing is questionable; Michael Longley, for example, provocatively wrote that "the poetry would have happened anyway" (Dugdale et al. 57). While it is impossible to accurately tease out questions of influence or might-have-beens, we <em>can</em> use it to look at the various descriptions of the people involved with the Group as a way of seeing how well our data matches up against the memories of the people involved.</p>

<p>For instance, Norman Dugdale discusses some of the most important members of the workshop in the "Symposium": "In my time, Hobsbaum, Heaney, Longley and Terry formed the core of the group" (Dugdale et al. 54). He goes on to say&mdash;using a poetic metaphor not inappropriate for network theory&mdash;that these four were "circled by many lesser moons and a shifting penumbra of casual attenders" (Dugdale et al. 54). How does this recollection comport with our data? Looking at our <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second network visualization</a>, which is based on the authorship and ownership of Group sheets with inferred dates, we find that Hobsbaum, Longley, and Heaney are in the top four or five nodes by almost every network measure that might indicate the importance of influence of a node in a network. These measures include the total number of connections that each of them has to other people ("degree"); their likelihood of being along the shortest path between any two points on the network ("betweenness centrality"); and how many connections the nodes that <em>they</em> are connected to have ("eigenvector centrality"). This last measure is often used as a proxy for understanding influence in a network and resembles the PageRank method that determines Google’s search results. In each of these measures, Hobsbaum is by far the highest, which can be attributed to his being the sole owner of the 66 Group sheets at Queen’s, which make up just under 50% of our data set (n=138).<sup id="ref-wn8" class="note"><a href="#wn8">[8]</a></sup> In this sense, our data for Hobsbaum, Heaney, and Longley matches Dugdale’s recollection of the Group...except for Arthur Terry.</p>

<p>Throughout our data, Terry&mdash;then a professor of Spanish at Queen’s and noted translator of Catalan works&mdash;is relatively unconnected to other members of the Belfast Group. First, since we do not have his papers in MARBL, we have neither record of his correspondence nor of his ownership of Group sheets.<sup id="ref-wn9" class="note"><a href="#wn9">[9]</a></sup> Having access to this information would have caused him to appear more prominently in our <a href="/network/belfast-group/">first</a> and <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second visualizations</a>, respectively. What’s more, we only have record of three Group sheets that he authored, all of them in the first period of the Group. Without a paper trail, then, he becomes relatively invisible in our measures, despite Dugdale’s pointing to his role in the "core of the group." More vexing, in <a href="/overview">our overview of the Belfast Group</a>, Enniss notes that Terry was a co-organizer of the second phase of the Group, along with the Heaneys and Michael Allen.<sup id="ref-wn10" class="note"><a href="#wn10">[10]</a></sup> (Michael Allen, it turns out, is even less represented in our data than Terry.) A way to reconcile our data and Dugdale’s recollection, then, is the likelihood that Terry became central to the Group <em>by</em> his bringing people together and attending meetings but did not author any Group sheets&mdash;or at least any that we know of&mdash;once Hobsbaum left.<sup id="ref-wn11" class="note"><a href="#wn11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>If we turn to the relationships clustered around James Simmons, we have another opportunity to compare our data with individuals’ perceptions about the Group. As noted above, Simmons found the feedback at the workshops to be <em>too</em> positive, on the whole. Still, he had "no doubt that those evenings were useful educational events" and "was glad to have some serious people paying attention to [his] work" (Dugdale et al. 59). In particular, he calls attention to Arthur Terry for being "particularly lucid and balanced as a critic"&mdash;and again pointing out Terry’s importance to the Group, despite what our data may seem to indicate (Dugdale et al. 59). Yet Simmons writes that his "memories of the whole thing are very vague" and, perhaps most germane for our purposes, claims, "I never really got to know any of them well, perhaps because I was that much older" (Dugdale et al. 60). Indeed, when we look at Simmons’s connections in our <a href="/network/belfast-group/">first network visualization</a>, which represents the relationships among individuals and organizations connected to the workshop, we see that he is a bit more isolated than other equally well known members of the Group. While Simmons has connections of varying strength with Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, and Paul Muldoon thanks to his correspondence with them, he lacks any connection whatsoever with Hobsbaum, Edna Longley, Ciaran Carson, or either Seamus or Marie Heaney. This of course does not mean that they didn’t know Simmons, but that our data does not account for the nature of their relationship. This lack of direct connections to some of the key members of the Group results in Simmons being excluded in our data model from a number of different cliques within the Belfast Group, where a "clique" is defined as a subgroup in a network where every individual is connected to every other individual. Whether it was his age or not, Simmons does seem to have "never really got to know" all of the members of the workshop as well as some others did.<sup id="ref-wn12" class="note"><a href="#wn12">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>We can see this disconnect play out more specifically in the relationship&mdash;or lack of one&mdash;between Simmons and Michael Longley. As already mentioned, Michael Longley states in the "Symposium," "I never saw Simmons at a Group meeting" (Dugdale et al. 56). Again, our data appear to corroborate this statement. When considering our <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second visualization</a>, which represents authors and owners of Group sheets, we see only a faint connection between the two authors. This comes from there being just a single Longley Group sheet in the Simmons papers and none whatsoever authored by Simmons in the Longley papers. This is somewhat surprising since Longley’s ten Group sheets make up the second largest total for a single author in the data set, and Simmons is tied for fourth with four Group sheets. Since the two men don’t own more of one another’s work in this format, there’s a strong likelihood that they did not attend the same Group meetings. Also plausible, of course, is the fact that one or both of them simply didn’t keep the other’s work.<sup id="ref-wn13" class="note"><a href="#wn13">[13]</a></sup> If Longley did not see Simmons at Group meetings, there is a good chance that others did not connect with him either.</p>

<p>While Simmons claims in the <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>&mdash;a publication that he founded&mdash;that he didn’t really remember the Group meetings nor know the participants well, he also undermines that claim in the same paragraph: "I seem to remember preferring some of Joan Newman’s [sic] poems (Joan Watton she was then and lodged with us in Lisburn). [...] Stewart Parker and Hugh Bredin I remember too" (Dugdale et al. 60).<sup id="ref-wn14" class="note"><a href="#wn14">[14]</a></sup> Our <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second network visualization</a> indeed shows a connection between Simmons and these three poets. In each of these three cases, the edge between Simmons and the other poet is the same weight because there are two Group sheets from each of them in Simmons’s papers in MARBL. Due to this, one might reasonably assume that Simmons had the same sort of relationship with Parker, Bredin, and Watton Newmann. Yet Simmons’s comments in the "Symposium" suggest that things should perhaps be visualized differently: while he "remembers" Parker and Bredin, Watton Newmann lodged with Simmons and his wife Laura Stinson. That surely suggests a stronger relationship, as do his further comments: "Joan Newman [sic] I knew and loved, the girl and her work, and so that is what remains with me of that period. The critical evenings I never think of; but the excitement of reading her poems as they came out is with me still" (Dugdale et al. 60). From the vantage point of 1976 when <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>, took his comments on the Belfast Group, it seems clear that Simmons feels no connection was as strong as that with Watton Newmann. Yet based on how our network data was collected, there was no way we could know about or include this external, affective connection between the two. So while our approach confirms some of what Simmons reports, it belies other&mdash;perhaps more important&mdash;parts of his recollections.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The examples in this essay hopefully point to how a data-centric approach can clarify our understanding of literary communities. Such a method allows us to verify claims made by members of the Group about who was there and what roles they played. It helps us tease out the different time periods within a protean group such as Hobsbaum’s writing workshop. And it helps us better conceive of the range of possible entities that could fall under the rubric of "the Belfast Group." At the same time, the recollections of Group members point to places where our data are incomplete and could, in all likelihood, <em>never</em> be complete. That said, we can imagine other questions to ask of the data: for example, examining the strength of relationships among what Hobsbaum calls the "founder members" and the relationships these founders form with "later entrants" (Dugdale et al. 55). Or, taking a page from Simmons, looking at the connections among poets of different generations, such as those like Ciaran Carson and Paul Muldoon who joined the Group in its second iteration. It’s possible that there will be no meaningful connections to be found when asking these questions, and that’s an outcome that should be familiar and acceptable to both literary scholars and digital humanists. But patterns will occasionally surface that scholars can interpret, and that chance makes it worth the pursuit.</p>

<ol class="notes">
<li id="wn1"><a href="#ref-wn1">^</a> The population of Belfast in 1961 was 415,856; by 1966 it had actually declined to 399,270 (Government of Northern Ireland 6). Contrast this with the population of London in 1961: 3,200,484 (<em>1961 Census of England and Wales</em>). Belfast was, in other words, a relatively small community, and Queen’s University made up an even smaller portion of that population. In 1966, there were a total of 5,371 students (full-time, part-time, and postgraduate) enrolled at Queen’s, and there were 562 full-time academic staff&mdash;88 of them in Arts&mdash;and 78 full-time lecturers (Clarkson 195-212 passim). Any literary community in Belfast and surrounding Queen’s would have been smaller still. Perhaps the grouping of disparate talents into a "school" can be attributed to this environmental scale, in which authors were likely to be in contact with one another.</li>

<li id="wn2"><a href="#ref-wn2">^</a> Biographical details about Pakenham are hard to come by, but we strongly suspect that he was teaching English at the secondary level rather than at a college.</li>

<li id="wn3"><a href="#ref-wn3">^</a> In <em>The Ulster Renaissance</em>, Heather Clark points to the friendship of Mahon with Longley, as well as with Heaney, as "forever link[ing] him with Hobsbaum’s Group": "Heaney, Mahon, and Longley formed a subset of that Group, which Michael Foley referred to as the ‘Tight Assed Trio.’ These three gave more readings together in Belfast during the 1960s than any other Group configuration, cementing the public’s perception of them as a clique" (57).</li>

<li id="wn4"><a href="#ref-wn4">^</a> In a 2000 interview with Heather Clark, Hobsbaum lists Michael Longley among the "later entrants" to the Group while identifying Edna Longley as an original member (Clark 55, 54). Yet in <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>’s "The Belfast Group: A Symposium," which was published in 1976 and therefore much closer to the events at hand, Hobsbaum names "Michael and Edna Longley" among the "founder members" (Dugdale et al. 55). Hobsbaum’s later account along with Michael Longley’s own recollection&mdash;"The group was a going concern by [the time I attended]: I can in no way be seen as a founding member"&mdash;suggests that the former was simply mistaken in <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em> (Dugdale et al. 56). </li>

<li id="wn5"><a href="#ref-wn5">^</a> Mahon’s comments about his presence at the Group are reported as fact by Frank Ormsby in the introductory remarks to "Symposium" in <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em> (53). Stephen Enniss’s biography of Mahon repeats the claim, based on his schedule of courses at Trinity and his moves to Paris and Canada in 1964 and 1965, respectively (57, 61-62). Finally Hobsbaum, in an email to Clark in 2005, stated that Mahon attended the Group just once "when he was back in Belfast" (55). The claim is a little less precise when reported by Longley in the "Symposium," however; he writes that "Mahon was present only once or <em>twice</em> as a kind of outside observer when he happened to be back in Belfast and staying with me" (56, emphasis added). While the possibility of Mahon’s attending more than once is intriguing, in the end, it is not critical to know exactly how many times that Mahon attended the Group. Instead it’s simply worth noting (again) that humanities data are tricky, as they so often consist of memories and paper trails.</li>

<li id="wn6"><a href="#ref-wn6">^</a> In a “Recollection” about the Belfast Group, Hobsbaum writes, “The tendency to use the Belfast Group as a means of revision was not general” (178) which corroborates Longley’s statement.</li>

<li id="wn7"><a href="#ref-wn7">^</a> While some individuals declined to comment for <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>, it is very likely that not everyone who participated in the Group was invited to do so. In his editorial comments Frank Ormsby does not make it clear whom he contacted, but it is safe to assume that some of the less well known or less published participants&mdash;Iris Bull, Hugh Bredin, Lynette M. Croskery, or Joan Watton Newmann (about whom more below), among others&mdash;probably were not asked. It is especially interesting to note that no women contributed to the "Symposium."</li>

<li id="wn8"><a href="#ref-wn8">^</a> When calculating these same network measurements against the complete data set (as represented in our <a href="/network/belfast-group/">first network visualization</a>, which shows individuals connected to the Belfast Group including second-degree connections), both Longley and Heaney remain ranked in the top five individuals in measure of degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Hobsbaum, on the other hand, falls considerably in every measure. This can be attributed to the fact that the complete data set relies heavily on the collections in MARBL which holds the bulk of Heaney’s and Longley’s papers, but only a small box of Hobsbaum’s materials. Our approach could be expanded to include materials at other archives&mdash;even if they did not natively expose their data in appropriate formats. Even if we had the time and resources to do this work, <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/philiphobsbaumcollection/">Hobsbaum’s papers</a> have not yet (as of this writing) been processed at the University of Glasgow.</li>

<li id="wn9"><a href="#ref-wn9">^</a> The fact that Terry’s papers have not been collected neither in MARBL nor anywhere, including the University of Essex where he worked for 21 years (Philip Terry), says something again about the <a href="#archival-bias">biases inherent in archives</a>. Since Terry was a scholar and a translator, his output is seen as less valuable and interesting to most archives.</li>

<li id="wn10"><a href="#ref-wn10">^</a> Terry’s obituary in <em>The Guardian</em> corroborates both Dugdale’s and Enniss’s comments about him: "In the Belfast Writers' Group, founded in 1963, his original contributions were limited to verse translations, but his presence was indispensable, as was his organising work. A valued friend to poets since his Barcelona days, he now won esteem from Philip Hobsbaum, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley and many others" (Round).</li>

<li id="wn11"><a href="#ref-wn11">^</a> A recent email from Arthur Terry’s son Philip to the authors helps establish that Terry was indeed in attendance in the second half of the Group (Philip Terry). Philip Terry included scans of three Group sheets (two identical) enclosed in his father’s copy of Seamus Heaney’s <em>Death of a Naturalist</em> (1966). One of these Group sheets is carries the same handwritten note (subsequently duplicated) and about the date of the workshop as appears on copies of the Group sheet in the Simmons and Carson papers in MARBL. Since Carson did not participate until the second phase of the Group, we have clear evidence that Terry did as well. If these Group sheets were added to an archival collection and made part of our data set, Terry would consequently be connected to the second phase of the Group.</li>

<li id="wn12"><a href="#ref-wn12">^</a> Clark writes extensively about how Simmons perpetually felt excluded from the Belfast poetry scene, both during and after the Belfast Group workshops; see 87-89, 176-82 passim.</li>

<li id="wn13"><a href="#ref-wn13">^</a> It is interesting to note that while there is no correspondence in MARBL between Simmons and Heaney, the Simmons papers do have three Heaney Group sheets. This marks in some ways the reverse of the Simmons-Longley relationship, where there is considerable correspondence, but almost no Group sheets. The two graphs measure different things and point simultaneously to the limitations of a data-centric approach (the fact that Simmons clearly had a relationship with both Heaney and Longley) and its strengths (the fact that these relationships seem to be of a different quality).</li>

<li id="wn14"><a href="#ref-wn14">^</a> In <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em>, Simmons refers to Watton by her married name, Joan Newmann, although he spells it incorrectly as "Newman" (Dugdale et al. 60). For consistency’s sake, we use her full name to refer to her, since her maiden name appears on her Group sheets.</li>

<h2>Archival Biases and Futures</h2>

<h3>Archival Biases</h3>

<p>Social network analysis is typically used where data are complete and all connections within a system are known. However, as other humanities networking projects have discovered, building a network based on historical data means that we are inevitably working with incomplete information. In other words, the lack of connections in our graph doesn't mean that no connection exists, but only that we have no documented evidence of one. For a large-scale, historical project like the <a href="http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/">Republic of Letters</a>, this incomplete information is due to the historic nature of the content they are working with; in other words, not all of the evidence exists any more (see Chang).<sup id="ref-an1" class="note"><a href="#an1">[1]</a></sup> In our case, we have a different bias and different missing data because we have primarily used information from a single archive as the source of our network data.<sup id="ref-an2" class="note"><a href="#an2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Emory's Manuscript, Archives, Rare Book Library (<a href="http://marbl.library.emory.edu/">MARBL</a>) has a strong collection of Irish literary materials, which is part of what inspired this project in the first place, but certainly there are other archives in Ireland, the U.K., and the U.S. with other materials that would be relevant to this project. For example, Philip Hobsbaum's papers are <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/philiphobsbaumcollection/">held at the University of Glasgow</a>, where they are still being processed. Including information about his correspondence would without a doubt increase the number and strength of his connections, as well as introduce other individuals into the orbit of the Belfast Group. As linked open data becomes available in the future, it should be possible to incorporate data from additional archival collections into a project like this.</p>

<p>Even beyond the fact that our data is limited by the selection of collections we've pulled correspondence information from, there is a bias in our data and network models simply because it is based on data from archival collections. As discussed in <a href="#women">our essay on women in the Belfast Group and our network models</a>, certain types of people tend to be more prominent in archival collections than others&mdash;namely, famous authors. Our network is based on what archives have collected; what archivists have determined is worth keeping; and how much detail those archivists have used to describe those materials. Some manuscripts collections in MARBL are described in much greater detail than others. (For example, prior to this project, all the Group sheets in the James Simmons papers were described collectively as "Belfast Group sheets." To generate more accurate data, we created item-level descriptions of the individual sheets.) Similarly, the level of detail in the description of an author’s correspondence varies widely. Our data are incomplete for collections&mdash;such as the Derek Mahon papers&mdash;where the processing archivists chose to mention correspondents that they considered notable rather than explicitly naming every individual. Observing the gaps in our data is not to impugn the work of our archivists; processing a collection is extremely labor intensive and a complete description of materials would ultimately border on facsimile, as the fable from Borges makes clear.<sup id="ref-an3" class="note"><a href="#an3">[3]</a></sup> What's more, the conditions of a gift to an archive&mdash;the terms of which are generally not disclosed&mdash;could influence the extent of the descriptions.</p>

<p>The biases inherent in our archival-based data are more evident when looking at the full network generated from our data, especially when algorithmically detected communities are highlighted. </p>

<p>TODO [insert image] / link to GEXF</p>

<p>We generally see distinct communities for the major figures corresponding to specific MARBL collections, such as Paul Muldoon, Peter Fallon, Tom Paulin, and Ted Hughes; even emeritus Emory faculty member Ron Schuchard has a small community distinct from the rest of the network. The number of distinct communities is most likely the result of the large number of correspondents detailed in each of these collections who do not appear in the other collections. Heaney, Longley, Mahon, and Carson are much more centrally connected in this network representation. While literary historians like Heather Clark would certainly place Heaney and Longley at the center of narratives about the Group, they appear centrally here due to the efforts of our library to collect materials from those connected to the Belfast Group. Our data, again, reflect our collections as much as they reflect reality. When considering the communities in the illustration, one finds several of the Belfast Group in the community: Longley, Carson, Simmons, Ormsby, Hobsbaum. This detail surprised us given the fact that, as we noted on the <a href="/network/belfast-group/">interactive network graph</a>, there are no connections between Simmons and Carson.<sup id="ref-an4" class="note"><a href="#an4">[4]</a></sup> The lack of connection is perhaps explained by Simmons’s more frequent participation in the initial gatherings under Hobsbaum, while Carson who is Simmons’s junior by 15 years could only participate in the second half of the Group.<sup id="ref-an5" class="note"><a href="#an5">[5]</a></sup> Yet, the algorithm placed in the same community, in large part thanks to their connection to some of the same correspondents. Perhaps this placement can be explained by them both spending almost their entire careers in Northern Ireland, as opposed to Heaney or Muldoon, who worked in the US and other countries. By virtue of remaining in the same environs, Simmons and Carson have a smaller circle of correspondents&mdash;at least in our data&mdash;which makes it less likely for them to be sorted into another community.

<h3>Archival Futures</h3>

<p>The limitations and biases that we’ve described above are simply the nature of archives, and researchers need to be aware of them when doing any sort of archival work, including data-driven approaches. With these caveats in mind, a network approach to archival data can still reveal new things about literary histories. What’s more, a network approach could transform how we use the archive itself.</p>

<p>By applying the same methodology taken for this project, we could enhance data in finding aids from all of MARBL or another large archive. We could then use the resulting data to get a broader sense of the networks within the full archive. MARBL’s collection strengths in Irish literature, African-American literature and culture, and Southern history, would likely appear on a larger scale when we look for communities within the full network of people represented by the archive. But we might also find unexpected connections bridging those communities that might escape the notice of most researchers or even individual archivists. Visualizing the network of the entire library could be a useful tool for scholars and researchers, enabling them to find related materials in other collections and get a better sense of their research subjects within the context of the archive. Indeed, such an interactive visualization might go a long way to replacing the finding aids as the primary interface to an archive’s materials. If multiple institutions began using linked open data in this manner, it would even help a researcher identify other collections in which she or he might look for related materials. Creating such a network could also be a helpful tool for archives to give potential donors a beautiful, big-picture view of the collections in the archive and how their materials might connect. </p>

<ol class="notes">
  <li id="an1"><a href="#ref-an1">^</a> Of course it is worth noting that there are gaps in the historical record of events of the Belfast Group, which took place only 50 years ago. For example, while our data set contains information about all the Group sheets that are known to exist, we almost certainly do not know the location of all them. Any of the participants could have kept the sheets from the meetings they attended. We have recently learned, for example, that Arthur Terry kept a couple of Seamus Heaney Group sheets that have been uncollected in any archive (Terry).</li>
  <li id="an2"><a href="#ref-an2">^</a> There are many reasons why our information primarily comes from one archive. The first and most obvious is that since we work at Emory, we have easy access to the documents here. But more importantly, we had the ability to make changes to how the Emory finding aids expose data. We draw directly from the enhanced finding aids to generate the data for the site. By contrast, the finding aids for the Belfast Group materials at Queen’s University Belfast are a PDF. While we have incorporated those data, since this project is about enhancing and re-combining library data, working in our own environment is most conducive to demonstrating what is possible. We hope that other libraries will begin exposing their collections in similar ways.</li>
  <li id="an3"><a href="#ref-an3">^</a> Jorge Luis Borges. "Museum: On Exactitude in Science." In <em>Collected Fictions</em>. Trans. Andrew Hurley. New York: Viking, 1999. 325.</li>
  <li id="an4"><a href="#ref-an4">^</a> There is a direct connection between Carson and Simmons in our <a href="/network/belfast-group/groupsheets/">second network graph</a>, which visualizes relationships that we have inferred among Group members based on Group sheet ownership. Carson and Simmons both owned the same Heaney Group sheet. This suggests the following possibilities: 1) they both attended these meetings but didn’t know one another or form a relationship that would lead to correspondence or other connections; 2) one or both of them received a mailed copy of the Group sheet but did not attend the meeting in question; or 3) one of them got the Group sheet through some other means. Since the Simmons papers have seven Group sheets from the second period of the Group, it seems likely that he did attend but did not, for whatever reason, for a relationship with Carson such that it shows up in our <a href="/network/belfast-group/">first network visualization</a>. Such, again, are the biases and gaps in archival data.</li>
  <li id="an5"><a href="#ref-an5">^</a> In reflecting on the Belfast Group meetings, Simmons says, "I never got to know any of them well, perhaps because I was older" (Dugdale et al. 60). In <em>The Ulster Renaissance</em>, however, Heather Clark makes it clear that Simmons did indeed know Heaney, Longley, and Mahon well. Nevertheless he felt increasingly that he was "exclu[ded] from the poetry community" in Northern Ireland (88; see also 176-182 passim).</li>

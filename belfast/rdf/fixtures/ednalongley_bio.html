<!-- This is a little bit of a cheat.  The Michael Longley finding aid includes a series
     with Edna Longley materials, which has a brief biographical description of her, but is not
     structured in a way that it can be harvested via RDF.   Adding it as a fixture
     here so that we can provide a profile page for Edna Longley. -->

<!-- This biography is taken directly from the IWWiP. Doing this matches the approach that we are taking with our other biographies, since we aren't trying to write them ourselves. That said, it's a very different style from what we've done in the other entries, but I don't know that there is a way around this without writing our own Wikipedia entry. -->

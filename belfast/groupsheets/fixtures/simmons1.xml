              <l>Perhaps never, or only when drunk, does life</l>
              <l>Seem as it once seemed, a war to be won.</l>
              <l>The moving and influential things they devised</l>
              <l>Have all be said and done, it seems, by others.</l>
              <l>Some do the very things that they despised</l>
              <l>And recognise the enemy as brothers;</l>
              <l>And even those who've gained more power or sense</l>

              <l n="1">I wanted a walled garden's protected peace,</l>
              <l>With many bushes, tall flowers and trees,</l>
              <l>A wooden, well-aired bower in a simple design,</l>
              <l>With a watertight roof and a dry seat, to be mine.</l>
              <l>A gardener would come, but not to groom it for shows</l>
              <l>And not in the long afternoons when the pubs close.</l>
              <l>He would grumble because it is wild, but not care,</l>
              <l>And I'd be securely alone in the open air.</l>

            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>But walls are a warning not to break the laws</l>
              <l>Of trespass.  Damn it!  Already I see the flaws:</l>
              <l>Boys, forbidden or fined, would upset my peace.</l>
              <l>They would clamber or mock if I didn't connive with police</l>
              <l>To catch them.   The knowledge of good and evil seems</l>
              <l>To infect any garden.   I'd squirm with dreams</l>
              <l>Of others wanting a part of my too great share</l>
              <l>In the this overpopulous country.   I would care.</l>

              <l>With the wrong that privilege is from the other view;</l>
              <l>But to live in a garden's the only way to find</l>

              <l>I have undressed this small perfect body:</l>
              <l>It's holy now. I have caressed her white neck</l>
              <l>Which is bruised where the rope choked her.</l>

              <l>And gentleness abused, why youth met death.</l>
              <l>And all those years I was expecting</l>
              <l>Have been cancelled - the new life she won,</l>
              <l>Married to me, free from her mad relations.</l>

            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>Martyr indeed!  Her sisters were undone by loving</l>
              <l>Edmund - lucky bastard, only a liar could reach them;</l>
              <l>It was a family quarrel that Cordelia won.</l>

              <l>It was the acuteness of her love</l>
              <l>That made her silent, not pride.</l>
              <l>Her love and her dear father would be justified</l>
              <l>When time taught him to see the only way.</l>
              <l>I could agree, but then, "My father is being tried</l>
              <l>Too far - and tried by whom?" she'd say.</l>
              <l>"None of these people understands his ways</l>
              <l>Like me. There isn't time for holidays!"</l>
              <l>"Not holidays," I said.  "Your life is here.</l>
              <l>He must choose now, you've made the issues clear.</l>
              <l>This follows from your silence - you weren't cold</l>
              <l>But wise, kind in the bravest way."  She said, "He's old."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <head>3</head>
              <l>I gave her many good and interesting gifts</l>
              <l>And new friends with wit and courage equal to hers.</l>
              <l>While they were analysing and construing</l>
              <l>And recommending liberal reforms, she'd say,</l>
              <l>"I must go home, What is Goneril going?"</l>
              <l>"To keep control of things I should have lied.</l>
              <l>Truth is a luxury and I'd rather</l>
              <l>Stop serving ideals and serve my father."</l>
              <l>I told her there was no control of outcomes,</l>
              <l>"Your father would have suffered either way;</l>
              <l>Pain is the rent on life.  Whoever chooses</l>
              <l>Wisely will still suffer when others lose."</l>
              <l>"Well, then I should have stayed like Kent."</l>
              <l>My patience tried too far I said,</l>
              <l>"Kent has the virtues of an English dog - that's all.</l>
              <l>He serves blindly, barks at his master's enemies,</l>
              <l>Comes to his call always and finally dies</l>
              <l>On his master's grave - humorous, brave, useful;</l>
              <l>But for all his good service, what will he save?"</l>
              <l>She only answered, "He's better than you or I -</l>
              <l>Give me your army."  And I, to please her,</l>
              <l>Have let me own countrymen go to die.</l>
              <l>Why are so many involved?  Why?  Why?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <head>4</head>
              <l>Oh they were fascinators - Lear and his children -</l>
              <l>Mad, bad, treacherous;  all of them found</l>
              <l>Faithful servants to watch and set forward</l>
              <l>Their family spree of love and hate.  They cared</l>
              <l>Nothing for us, all for their damned family</l>
              <l>And yet I am crying, I am ready to lie down</l>
              <l>And die like Gloucester did and Kent will, like the clown.</l>

              <l>To sing a song I respect and delight in</l>
              <l>And have practised and sing well.</l>
              <l>The talking pauses, I relax and sing better,</l>
              <l>The talking swells slowly, louder and louder:</l>
              <l>No one is moved, I blush and deteriorate.</l>
              <l>"What will I do?" I ask myself -</l>
              <l>Still singing, but choked with shame.</l>
              <l>Should I stop?  Should I shout?  I shrug</l>
              <l>And go on singing, hearing myself:</l>
              <l>I practise for a time when people are listening:</l>
              <l>My singing improves.</l>
              <l rend="indent21">I move upstairs</l>
              <l>To sing on the landing and the crowd is hostile</l>
              <l>Still, but more docile.  They hear me out</l>
              <l>And are pleased enough:  I sing quite well;</l>
              <l>But the people grow restive, are talking</l>
              <l>After two more songs.   I sing one more</l>
              <l>And move to the hall for another performance.</l>

            </epigraph>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l n="1">Going home alone this deserted Saturday,</l>
              <l>As a child goes back to heaven, the longest way,</l>
              <l>I knock at my usual doors to company</l>
              <l>But pubs and coffee-lounge are closed, even the library.</l>
              <l>It is clear to my mind when lifted awhile from self-pity</l>
              <l>That blessings fall as surely as the soot</l>
              <l>That made this spire a member of the black city -</l>
              <l>God's mission to bankers or banker's loot.</l>
              <l>Red-brick terrace houses and bare trees</l>
              <l>Etched on a water-coloured sky, a cage of girders,</l>
              <l>The worn pavement, all that my eye sees</l>
              <l>Please me, being themselves, my beloved warders.</l>
              <l>They are clothed in today's unique weather - not queer</l>
              <l>But clearly defined by hour, season and year.</l>
              <l>I am blessed and neglect the blessing and walk again,</l>
              <l>Blindly hearing the mind rehearse its pain.</l>
              <l>"I am not myself.  These streets were the scene</l>
              <l>Of my daily life.  Involved in projects and routine</l>
              <l>I passed here often and return as a ghost</l>
              <l>To tour sites, seeing where my time was lost.</l>
              <l>Ghosts should accuse their murderers;  I shiver</l>
              <l>At my own moaning but have no message to deliver.</l>
              <l>A perturbed spirit with meal time for a clock</l>
              <l>I start back as the bells say, "six o'clock"</l>
              <l>To the nicest woman I have ever met,</l>
              <l>Where my bed is made and tea table set.</l>
